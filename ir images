storing images for ir remote app

1) store images in global small bitmap array
	- dev has to add images to array and recompile watch system
	- more difficult to make changes by only modifying stuff on the sd
	- images take up space in ram that will never be freed (maybe use PROGMEM?)
	
2) store images in separate subdirectory on sd
	- when would images be loaded?
		- on initSD() (into small bitmap array)?
			- would this increase time to execute?
			- how to prevent duplication of icons
			- the images would only have to be loaded once
		- on loading an ir profile?
			- would the images be reloaded every time the button grid is rewdrawn, or
			  is there some mechanism where you can preload several images and draw them later?
				- yes
					Adafruit_Image img;
					reader.loadBMP("/image.bmp", img);
					img.draw(oled, x, y);
				- maybe have a vector of Adafruit_Images (like calc_buttons and commands)
				- if the code object has a btn_image key, draw the image, otherwise, print the btn text
	- would have to use adafruit imagereader
	- dev wouldn't have to create a byte array (they would just drop a bmp in a folder)
	
3) store byte array in json file
	- if several profiles have the same icon, the data is repeated
	- doesn't depend on any external files
