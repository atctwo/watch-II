The system uses a fork of IRRemote that adds ESP32 support (https://github.com/ExploreEmbedded/Arduino-IRremote).  In the file boarddefs.h, the
value of TIMER_PWM_PIN (line 565) was changed from 5 to 12, and the value of TIMER_CHANNEL (line 563) was changed from 1 to 2.

The TFT screen is controlled using Bodmer's wonderful TFT_eSPI library (https://github.com/Bodmer/TFT_eSPI).  This library is configured using a
User setup header file in the library's source directory.  The file is cloned in the docs folder of this repo (it's called "Setup_watch2.h").

The ESP32 Arduino core was modified to enable C++17 support.

The core was also modified to double the stack size of the loopTask.  Parameter 3 of the function xTaskCreateUniversal was changed to 16384.

The library csscolorparser included in the source directory isn't an Arduino library, so was included with the source.  It's GitHub repository can be found
at https://github.com/mapbox/css-color-parser-cpp.

The system uses one of nothings' stb libraries (https://github.com/nothings/stb), specifically stb_image.  stb_image was modified slightly to shut
the compiler up.  The modified library is included with the source.
