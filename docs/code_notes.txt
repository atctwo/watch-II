(1) Time
    During active mode operation, functions from TimeLib.h are used to conveniently handle the time.  These functions operate on an internal
    measure of time kept by the library, and don't touch the measure of time maintained by the ESP32.  This measure can be operated on using
    standard POSIX time functions from time.h and sys/time.h.  To ensure that the time is kept while sleeping, the time kept by TimeLib.h is
    used to set the time kept by the ESP32.  When the device goes to sleep, the ESP32 time is set to the TimeLib.h time, and when the device
    is woken up, the TimeLib.h time is set to the ESP32 time.  I know it's unneccessarily complicated, but shut up.

(2) Preferences
    User settings are stored in non-volatile storage (NVS) using the ESP32 library Preferences.  Some of these settings need to be accessed
    every iteration of the main loop (like timeout settings and theme colour settings).  It would be inefficient to access the settings from
    NVS every iteration, so global variables are used to keep copies of the setting values in RAM, allowing for faster access.  When the
    settings are changed, the global variables are set to the new values, and the NVS instances of the settings are updated.  When the
    system is turned on, the NVS settings are loaded, and are used to set the global variables.
