# Circuit Design Files

The schematic and PCB for the watch were designed using KiCad.  This folder has a few different subfolders, explained below.  All of the development on the current form of the schematic + PCB takes place in the `watch2_board` folder, although the rest of the folders are kept for archival purposes.

- `projects_are_a_bad_idea` an old 1.27mm pitch ESP32 breakout board
- `watch2` an old proof-of-concept version of the watch2 board design 
- `watch2_board` the current version of the board design
